# MoE Router Simulator Configuration
# Default configuration for running routing strategy experiments

# Router parameters
num_experts: 128    # Total number of available experts
K: 8                # Number of experts to select per token (top-K routing)
cache_size: 32      # Maximum number of experts to keep in cache
k1: 3               # First threshold for load balancing (DDR path limit)
k2: 2               # Second threshold for load balancing (PIM path limit)

# Bandwidth model (normalized values)
flash_to_ddr: 1.0   # Bandwidth from Flash to DDR
ddr_to_npu: 8.0     # Bandwidth from DDR to NPU  
flash_to_pim: 4.0   # Bandwidth from Flash to PIM

# Simulation settings
num_tokens: 1000     # Number of tokens to simulate
random_seed: 42      # Random seed for reproducibility

# Smoothness levels to test
# 0.0 = random workload (high cache miss)
# 1.0 = static workload (low cache miss after warmup)
smoothness_levels:
  - 0.0
  - 0.5
  - 0.9
  - 0.99
  - 1.0
